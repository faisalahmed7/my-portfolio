            <p>Simplicity is the state or quality of being simple. Something easy to understand or explain seems simple,
                in
                contrast to something complicated. Alternatively, as Herbert A. Simon suggests, something is simple or
                complex
                depending on the way we choose to describe it. In some uses, the label "simplicity" can imply beauty,
                purity, or
                clarity. In other cases, the term may suggest a lack of nuance or complexity relative to what is
                required
